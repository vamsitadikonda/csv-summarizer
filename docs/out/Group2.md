## Scoring Criterion

|Notes|Score (Total = 39)|Evidence|
|-----|----------|--------|
|Video1|0|NA for HW|
|Video2|0|NA for HW|
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/SunandiniM/Group2_HW2/graphs/contributors)|
|Number of commits|3|Total 53 commit history|
|Number of commits: by different people|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/SunandiniM/Group2_HW2/graphs/contributors)|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|0|NA because No Issues|
|Issues are being closed|0|NA because No Issues|
|DOI badge: exists|3|Exists in [README.md](https://github.com/SunandiniM/Group2_HW2/blob/main/README.md)|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |0| doco not proper|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|Can't find docs|

|Issues are discussed before they are closed|0|Issues not found|
|Chat channel: exists|0|NA|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|2|Basic testing is done and no issues are found|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|0|No way to identify|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|0|No shared config file found|
