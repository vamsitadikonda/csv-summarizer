## Scoring Criterion

|Notes|Score (Total = 33)|Evidence|
|-----|----------|--------|
|Video1|0|NA for HW|
|Video2|0|NA for HW|
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/CSC510-G35-Fall2022/csc510-g35-hw2/graphs/contributors)|
|Number of commits|3|Total 64 commit history|
|Number of commits: by different people|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/CSC510-G35-Fall2022/csc510-g35-hw2/graphs/contributors)|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|2|Few issues closed, but few open|
|Issues are being closed|2|5 Issues closed, 6 open|
|DOI badge: exists|3|Exists in [README.md](https://github.com/CSC510-G35-Fall2022/csc510-g35-hw2/blob/main/README.md)|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |1|Docs found, with only out folder|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |0|Can't find needed description details in docs|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|0|Can't find needed examples in docs|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|0|Can't find needed details in docs|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|Can't find docs|
|Use of version control tools|3|Using GitHub for version control|
|Use of style checkers |0|Code Linting Not Integrated [GitHub Action](https://github.com/CSC510-G35-Fall2022/csc510-g35-hw2/actions)|
|Use of code formatters. |0|Code Linting Not Integrated [GitHub Action](https://github.com/CSC510-G35-Fall2022/csc510-g35-hw2/actions)|

|Use of code coverage |3|SonarQube Analysis via GitHub actions, code-coverage presented in README|
|Other automated analysis tools|0|NA|
|Test cases exist|3|Tests exists in test folder|
|Test cases are routinely executed|0|No scheduled GitHub action|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|2|Yes contributing.md is descriptive, but enhancements not mentioned|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|2|Issues found, not enough description, but title slightly help understand the issue|
|Chat channel: exists|0|NA|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|1|Mainly testing a few scenarios, with code coverage only 74%|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|0|No way to identify|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|0|No shared config file found|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|0|No way to identify|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|2|Well spread across contributions are noticed by commit history|
|Short release cycles |2|One Short release cycle found|
