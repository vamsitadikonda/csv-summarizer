### Total Score:

## Scoring Criterion

|Notes|Score|Evidence|
|-----|----|--------|
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|3|evidence in GH|
|Number of commits|3|in GH|
|Number of commits: by different people|3|in GH|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|
|Issues are being closed|3|evidence in GH|
|DOI badge: exists|3|in GH|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly ||in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |
|Use of version control tools|
|Use of style checkers ||config files in GH showing your config|
|Use of code formatters. ||config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
|Use of syntax checkers. ||config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  |
|Use of code coverage |3|config files in GH|
|Other automated analysis tools|3|config files in GH|
|Test cases exist|3|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|
|Test cases are routinely executed|3|E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|3||
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|3||
|Short release cycles || (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
